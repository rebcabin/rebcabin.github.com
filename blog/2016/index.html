<h1>Calling the C world from the Scheme World</h1>

<p>A brief essay, with examples, by</p>

<p>Brian Beckman</p>

<p>Updated 12 January 2000 (thanks to John D. Corbett for
probing questions)</p>

<p>Original 19 August 1999</p>

<p>brianbec@hotmail.com</p>

<h2>What are we trying to do?</h2>

<p>We'd like to call programs written in C and C++ from
programs written in Scheme. You thought I was going to say &quot;and <i>vice
versa</i>&quot;, but that's not entirely true. Some C programs call other C
programs through explicit <em>function pointers</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>, or</span></em> <em>callbacks</em>. The only case in which we need C
to call Scheme is the case of callbacks. In other words, we want to call C and
C++ from Scheme and we want write our callbacks from C and C++ in Scheme.</p>

<p>To be a bit more blunt about it, we want Scheme to be in
charge, and we want C and C++ programs to be the unwitting slaves of Scheme. In
other words, we'd like our Scheme to be able to call <em>any</em> C/++ code
whether that code was ever intended to be called by some other programming
system. And, we want our methods to scale to real-world C/++ programs. For
example, we'd like to call kernel32.dll and oleaut32.dll from Scheme code.</p>

<p>We can expand our ambitions to C++ vtables and to COM. If we
can call C, we ought to be able to call through a vtable, which is just an
array of (non-callback) function pointers. So, our class of unwitting slaves
includes all of C++ and COM, including OLE Automation Servers, because all of
these are based on vtables. From now on, then, I'll write “C&quot; and mean “C
and C++ and COM and OLE Automation&quot; because we can handle all these cases
in the same way.</p>

<p>We require <em>only</em> that the target C code be packaged
in a DLL, or Dynamically Linked Library, and that the DLL <em>export</em> its
entry points symbolically. DLLs are a very general standard for symbolic
linking at runtime in the C-programming world on Microsoft platforms like
Windows. Instead of using the operating system's symbolic linking loader, we'll
just gin up our own inside an implementation of Scheme. This is how we're going
to call C functions in DLLs. <span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<p>All that said, this is just a demonstration. We're not
actually trying to make an industrial-strength, shippable Scheme product that
can call C. Instead, we're trying to demonstrate solutions to the
&quot;hard&quot; problems of callbacks and transformations among C types to
Scheme types, and leave the problems of incorporating these solutions into a
product-grade implementation to others. However, this is <em>not</em> mere
theory: we show actual solutions to these problems in real, scalable code, and
we call big, hairy DLLs like kernel32.dll and oleaut32.dll directly, with no
glue code written in C, and we’ve stressed this by calling millions of
iterations over the “hard” bits. <span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<h2>Why would you want to do that?</h2>

<p>Up front, let me say that I'm not trying to advertise or
proselytize or push my work in the slightest way.I built it for my own reasons and just thought some other Scheme
and Siod users might find it amusing if not useful.</p>

<p>C is a wonderful language for writing libraries of
special-purpose and high-performance components. It's a lousy language for algorithms,
data structures, scripting, distributed command and control, experimentation,
prototyping, learning by doing, and so on. That is, it’s so-so when you need
lots of flexibility and elbow room or when you need to focus on the application
domain. C forces you to do all your own pipe-fitting and resource management,
as well as to invent data formats and write custom I/O code for your
application data.</p>

<p>Scheme is great for flexibility and elbow room and for
maximizing the impact of your precious programming hours by taking care of data
formats, types, and resources for you. But Scheme is not so good for special-purpose,
high-performance libraries.</p>

<p>So, let's use C for what it's good for and Scheme for what
it's good for. Let's also decide that we want to use all kinds of C libraries
that might only have been intended to be called from other C programs. We want
to be able to use libraries tomorrow we haven’t thought about today without
having to drop everything and invent new, abstract wrappers for them. So we
need to make our Scheme smart enough to fool C into thinking it's being called
by C. This isn't as hard as it sounds.</p>

<h2>C isn't Safe; how can you call it?</h2>

<p>Everyone knows that Scheme is safer than C. Most
memory-corruption bugs are simply impossible in Scheme, and they're quite easy
in C. In fact, C is no safer than assembly language, and it's that way on
purpose. C is meant for hardcore programming close to the machine. While it has
nice abstraction features like static type-checking and object-oriented
programming, it <em>always</em> gives you a way to break the rules when you
need to do. If we're going to call arbitrary C code from Scheme, we need to
deal with the fact that C code doesn't have anything like Scheme's notion of
safety.</p>

<p>We have to open holes in Scheme's safety nets, but we can
close them all up on the Scheme side (even though we haven't done that
completely in this demonstration package). This means that we can do all sorts
of potentially unsafe things in some isolated bits of Scheme code, and we can
stress, debug, test, and quarantine all the unsafe code on the other side of a
well-defined fence. We'll show lots more on this below. <span style='font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<h2>What is the C World?</h2>


<p>This is best shown by example. Consider the following C
program:</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
__declspec (dllexport) int __stdcall    
TestVictim0 () {
    return 42 ;
    }
__declspec (dllexport) char * __stdcall
TV4 (char * s) {
    printf("Got this: \"%s\"\n", s) ;
    return s ;
    }
__declspec (dllexport) char * __cdecl
TV5cdecl (char * s, char * t) {
    return strcat (s, t) ;
    }
typedef int (*PFII) (int) ;
 
__declspec (dllexport) int __stdcall
TVcallback (int i1, int i2, PFII f) {
    int i = f ( i1 * i2 ) ;
    return i ;
    }
</pre>


<p>That is source code for a little DLL that has four exports, <tt><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>TestVictim0</span></tt>, <tt><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>TV4</span></tt>, <tt><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>TV5cdecl</span></tt>, and <tt><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>TVcallback</span></tt>.
Trust me, the methods we develop here work for very big DLLs, like kernel32.dll
and oleaut32.dll, and we show it below.</p>

<p>This DLL is completely in the C world. There is nothing in
here about Scheme-like types. These exports give and take machine-word
integers; strings, as machine-level addresses; and functions as machine-level
addresses. All C-like stuff. Also, some of the entry points are cdecls, i.e.,
where caller pops arguments, and some of them are stdcalls, i.e., where callEE
pops arguments. The former have the advantage of flexibility, that is, you can
implement functions of variable arity, like printf, using cdecls. The latter
have the advantage of brevity: call sites do not need to take up space with
argument-popping instructions. <span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<p>If we can call cdecls and stdcalls with ints, strings, and
function pointers, we will have a sizeable fraction of the C world covered.
Further, we argue, we've got all the hard cases covered and the rest is
straightforward.</p>

<h2>What is the Scheme World?</h2>

<p>By example, once again. What should calls to the entry
points above look like? A very simple, but surprisingly useful assumption is that
C functions return machine words, which, on 32-bit architectures, are DWORDS or
unsigned longs. The C language permits a function to &quot;return a
struct&quot;, that is, an aggregate much larger than 32 bits. But, this
facility is not used very often in practice. Furthermore, compilers would be
likely to implement the facility by putting the data somewhere and having the
function return a pointer in a DWORD. <span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<p>The upshot is that we may cover the vast majority of
industrially important cases simply by assuming that C functions return DWORDs.
This makes the Scheme &quot;superglue&quot; easier. The &quot;superglue&quot;
is the generic C code we need to write as part of the Scheme implementation to
extend it so it can call arbitrary C code. This is different from special-purpose
&quot;glue&quot; that would extend Scheme so it could call a particular C
function. If you haven't gathered it by now, we eschew any use of
&quot;glue&quot; in favor of &quot;superglue&quot;. <span style='font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></span></p>

<p>All that said, here is a real trace of some calls from
Scheme, through Superglue, to the DLL shown above. The first one is easy to
understand--the function returns 42, which superglue turns from a C number into
a Scheme number. The next two return addresses, interepreted as Scheme numbers.
To get at the data inside, we need some superglue for converting from addresses
in the C world into values in the Scheme world. The last one converts the
Scheme closure into a C function (by dyanmically painting code bytes in
memory), calls it, and returns the answer.</p>

<pre>
(TestVictim0) --&gt; 42
(TV4 &quot;Hello World&quot;) --&gt; 0x7B6D80
(TV5cdecl &quot;yadda yadda, &quot; &quot;blah blah&quot;) --&gt; 0x7B6C00
(TVcallback 3 4 (lambda (x) (* 2 x))) --&gt; 24
</pre>


<p>To look inside the pointers returned by TV4 and TV5cdecl, we
use the Scheme Superglue function,
which takes a Scheme number, which must have the value of a C pointer pointing
to a C string, and conses up a fresh Scheme string. So, we get the following:</p>

<pre>
(cstring-&gt;string (TV4 &quot;Hello World&quot;)) --&gt; &quot;Hello World&quot;
(cstring-&gt;string (TV5cdecl &quot;yadda yadda, &quot; &quot;blah blah&quot;)) --&gt; &quot;yadda yadda, blah blah&quot;
</pre>


<h2>Multiary Callbacks: WndProcs</h2>

<p>Now, in Windows, a WndProc is a quaternary callback, that is, a</p>

<pre>
(lambda (hWnd msg wParam lParam) ...)
</pre>


<p>So, given multi-ary (or multiadic) callbacks, and given that we have a way to populate C structs (see structs.scm in the source below), then we should be able to write Windows applications entirely in Scheme, and we can; here’s “Hello, World!”:</p>

<pre>
(require "gdi32.scm")
(require "winuser.scm")
(require 'fm.scm)
 
(define (WndProc hWnd msg wParam lParam)
  (cond
   ((= msg WM_DESTROY) (PostQuitMessage 0))
   ((= msg WM_PAINT)
    (let* ((ps  (new-PAINTSTRUCT))
           (hDC (BeginPaint hWnd ps)))
      (TextOutA hDC 10 10 (string->cstring "Hello, World!") 13)
      (EndPaint hWnd ps) 0))
   (#t (DefWindowProcA hWnd msg wParam lParam))) )
 
(define (myCreateWindow)
  (let ((wc      (new-WNDCLASS))
        (clsNym  (string->cstring "GenericAppClass"))
        (appNym  (string->cstring "Generic Application"))
        (clsStyl (| CS_OWNDC (| CS_VREDRAW CS_HREDRAW)))
        (winStyl (| WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW (| WS_VISIBLE
                   (| WS_HSCROLL WS_VSCROLL))))
        (hInst   #x400000)
        (msg     (new-MSG)) )
 
    (WNDCLASS::set-lpszClassName wc clsNym)
    (WNDCLASS::set-lpfnWndProc   wc (callback WndProc ))
    (WNDCLASS::set-style         wc clsStyl)
    (WNDCLASS::set-hInstance     wc hInst)
    (WNDCLASS::set-hbrBackground wc 6)
 
    (ChkHandleReturn (RegisterClassA wc))
    (ChkHandleReturn (CreateWindowExA 0 clsNym appNym winStyl
                                      0 0 CW_USEDEFAULT CW_USEDEFAULT
                                      0 0 hInst 0))
 
    (while (GetMessageA msg 0 0 0)
           (TranslateMessage msg)
           (DispatchMessageA msg)) ))
</pre>


<h2>Hostile Foreign-Function Interface in SIOD</h2>

<p>We wrote a Hostile FFI for George Carette’s wonderful,
little SIOD program (<a href="http://people.delphi.com/gjc/siod.html">http://people.delphi.com/gjc/siod.html</a>).
The FFI is hostile because the C code doesn’t need to cooperate. We can run
kernel32, COM, Ole Automation, etc. Please feel free to download the <a
href="images/siodffi.zip">Visual
Studio 6.0 Project</a>. Build it, run it (you may have to adjust the project
directories in the Debug Tab of the Project\Settings dialog box; make sure the
program starts in the siodffi\scripts\scheme directory), and type</p>

<pre>(load &quot;regress.scm&quot;)</pre>


<p>This will run a bunch of tests on Superglue, calling
kernel32, calling raw COM, consing up callbacks like the ones documented above,
and calling OLE Automation. Type</p>

<pre>(load &quot;windows.scm&quot;)</pre>


<p>To see “Hello, World!” in action (wowee!!)</p>

<p>You can examine what’s going on and how we do it by just
looking at the scheme code in “regress.scm” and backtracking through the
Superglue code. Most of that code is in “Realload.cpp”, and there isn’t very
much of it. Superglue consists entirely of the following new Scheme functions
implemented in Realload.cpp and slib.cpp:</p>

<pre>
init_subr_1 ("GetProcAlist",          GetProcAlist ) ;
init_subr_1 ("GetProcAlistCDecls",    GetProcAlistCDecls ) ;
init_subr_2 ("MainDispatch",          MainDispatcher ) ;
init_subr_2 ("MainDispatchCDecl",     MainDispatcherCDecls ) ;
init_subr_1 ("cstring->string",       StringFromCString ) ;
init_subr_1 ("string->cstring",       CStringFromString ) ;
init_subr_1 ("array->rgpv",           RgPvFromLispArray ) ;
init_subr_2 ("rgpv->array",           LispArrayFromRgPv ) ;
init_subr_1 ("array->cbytes",         CByteArrayFromArray ) ;
init_subr_1 ("array->carray",         CByteArrayFromArray ) ;
init_subr_2 ("cbytes->array",         ByteArrayFromCByteArray) ;
init_subr_3 ("carray->array",         SiodArrayFromCByteArray) ;
init_subr_0 ("ScmGetSystemDirectory", SiodGetSystemDirectory ) ;
init_subr_0 ("sgsd",                  SiodGetSystemDirectory ) ;
init_subr_2 ("newVariant",            newVariant ) ;
    
init_subr_1 ("num->lisp",             LispFromFlonum    ) ;
init_subr_1 ("lisp->num",             FlonumFromLisp ) ;
init_subr_1 ("cptr->num",             FlonumFromCPtr ) ;
init_subr_1 ("num->cptr",             CPtrFromFlonum ) ;
init_subr_1 ("&",                     CPtrAddressOfCPtr ) ;
init_subr_0 ("cptr",                  newcptr ) ;
init_subr_1 ("val",                   indirect ) ;
init_subr_1 ("indirect",              indirect ) ;
init_subr_1 ("peek-dw",               indirect ) ;
init_subr_2 ("poke-dw",               pokeDw ) ;
init_subr_1 ("peek-byte",             peekByte ) ;
init_subr_2 ("poke-byte",             pokeByte ) ;
</pre>


<p>All the rest of the fun stuff is written in Scheme.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Ok, we have a pretty comprehensive solution to this, but
there’s another partial one in the world, too. The Rice University PLT group
has come up with a system for calling Active X controls from Scheme when those
controls are scripted in an HTML window. References are below.</p>

<h3>DrScheme V100</h3>

<p>This is very cool. It’s R4RS-compliant, and our gizmo is
not. But, it only calls ActiveX controls in an HTML context, and we call
arbitrary C/C++/COM DLLs. See <a
href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/">http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drscheme/</a></p>

<h2>Why not write safe, high-level Scheme Wrappers?</h2>

<p>Now, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I had four
reasons to opt for designing a &quot;hardcore, unsafe&quot; Hostile FFI over a
set of sane wrappers: laziness (typeI), laziness (typeII), coverage, and uniquess.
To elaborate:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<ol>
<li>Laziness (typeI): the Windows API is enormous: at least
5,000 APIs if one includes Multimedia, DirectX, OLE, (D)COM etc.; just
enumerate the exports in *.dll in your Windows directory.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To cover even a small fraction of it with
sane wrappers is a huge amount of work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I once did sane wrappers for GL on SGI machines, and that was weeks of
spade work for a 700-item API that is vastly simpler and more repetitive than
that of Windows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I couldn't imagine
actually trying to do it for Windows in the first place, let alone trying to
keep up with the deluge of new DLLs hitting the fan continually.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></li>
</ol>


<p>The lazy programmer's way out is to find a generic way to
suck up any and all the APIs, and that's the way I took.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This approach, BTW, is not different in
principle than the approch taken by Java FFI, Visual Basic's FFI, and a host of
others. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I just don't use those language
systems because I like scheme better (subjective rationale).&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Laziness (typeII): It's hard enough to learn the minimum,
required knowledge to write Windows programs. To learn this or that sane
wrapper system <em>before</em> finding out whether it can actually do what you need is
burdensome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, I wanted to
play with MIDI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was unable to find any
way to hook into the Windows MIDI API amongst the current crop of free scheme
implementations, e.g., DrScheme, VScheme, and SCM.Those are all fabulous systems, but I had to devote some
considerable time to learning them before realizing that I could not find out
how to work MIDI with them. Note that this was not time spent on Scheme itself,
but on the libraries and wrappers and interfaces and other accoutrements that
come with each system. Now, I'm not an expert in those systems, and they <em>may</em>
have MIDI capability, but I had only finite time to look and I couldn't find it
within my time horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had to trade
this off against how much time it would take me to write an FFI, and that
turned out to be 3 days (because I already had my own PE loader and I already
knew the insides of Siod). So this was another subjective point: it was easier
<em>for me</em> to do it my way. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p></li>
<li><p>Coverage: I sort of touched on this, but there is another
point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I do not know, today, what
corners of Windows I will need tomorrow (so this topic might be called
ignorance or blindness:). I would hate to have to derail my train-of-thought to
go design yet-another-sane-wrapper before I can get back to playing with
Windows. So, I trade &quot;sanity&quot; off against cognitive throughput: if I
can find away to slay the <em>entire</em> dragon (and all future dragons, to boot)
with one blow, then I don't ever have to think about it again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I'll gladly take a little insanity and
usafety in exchange. Subjective again. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p></li>
<li><p>Uniqueness: There are lots of sane-wrapper solutions out
there with their own pros and cons each.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I really didn't want to add another. &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></p></li>
</ol>
